## Introduction

Understanding baseball pitching dynamics is crucial for player development and game strategy. This project aims to analyze various aspects of baseball pitches, including speed, spin rate, and movement, to provide actionable insights.

## Project Structure

The repository comprises the following files:

- `baseballpitch.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations related to baseball pitches.

## Data Collection

Data was sourced from publicly available baseball datasets, which include detailed information on individual pitches, such as velocity, spin rate, and pitch type.

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data underwent the following preprocessing steps:

- **Cleaning**: Removal of missing values and correction of inconsistencies.
- **Normalization**: Scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity.
- **Encoding**: Conversion of categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for analysis.

These steps are detailed in the `baseballpitch.ipynb` notebook.

## Analysis

The analysis focuses on:

- **Pitch Velocity**: Examining the distribution and trends of pitch speeds.
- **Spin Rate**: Analyzing how spin rate affects pitch movement and effectiveness.
- **Pitch Type**: Investigating the performance and usage patterns of different pitch types.

Visualizations and statistical methods are employed to uncover patterns and insights.

## Results

The analysis revealed the following insights:

- **Velocity Trends**: Fastball velocities have increased over recent years, correlating with higher strikeout rates.
- **Spin Rate Impact**: Higher spin rates are associated with increased pitch movement, making pitches more challenging for batters.
- **Pitch Type Effectiveness**: Certain pitch types, such as sliders, have higher whiff rates, indicating their effectiveness in deceiving batters.

Detailed results and visualizations are available in the notebook.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gregcrooks75/Task.git
